      <!-- <p class="comment-text">My interests...</p> -->
      <p class="little-margin">
        I have a firm belief that each person has a list of certain things only they can create, ideas that are entirely
        unique to them and transient if ignored.</p>
      <p class="little-margin">Whether it is something as simple as a weekend inremental game coding project, or
        something as involved as a
        350 page fantasy novel, I have dedicated myself to the exhausting, never-ending, wonderful journey of identifing
        the things I am meant to create.
      </p>
      <p class="little-margin">
        I'll put some highlights below, but look for much more in the relevant
        sections in the sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>I love making things and do that in a lot of different areas.</p>

      <div class="project-div">
        <p class="title">Qyllscape</p>
        <p class="description">
          A minimalist writing editor, created in the Godot engine.
        </p>

      <h2>Game Development / YouTube</h2>
      <p>
        I'm
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrmX3SvpPerq-KAfGBrgGQ">building an audience</a>
        as I work on my game Population Undefined. I love solving problems and
        even more I love teaching others what I learned along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXaPGRkg_hY">one of my favorite videos here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Mobile App Development</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the apps I've made have been games, but not all of them. I
        made a
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buffed.stitch">crocheting stitch counter</a>
        that has gained quite a following, and recently I created a
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.orbitmeditation">minimalist meditation
          app</a>
        that I'm hoping to build an audience for.
      </p>

      <h2>Generative Art</h2>
      <p>
        I create
        <a href="https://github.com/erdavids/generative-art">generative art</a>
        with Python and JavaScript. If you're on desktop, you can see an
        example to the right!
      </p>

      <h2>Other Random Stuff</h2>
      <p>A few other things I love talking about...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am working on getting better at chess,
          <a href="https://lichess.org/@/TheBuffED">send me a challenge</a>!
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div id="projects-page" class="page-section">
      <p class="little-margin">I've accumulated quite a collection of "weekend projects" over the years, while a few of
        them have gone on to claim months or even years of my life.</p>

          <p class="little-margin">
            I primarily wanted a writing editor with responsive customization, so that I could somewhat view my writing as it would look in a book.</p>
            <p class="little-margin">Over time, I added additional features such as lighting, which became one of my favorites.
